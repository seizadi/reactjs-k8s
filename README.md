# reactjs-k8s

The motivation for this project was a container that would run the ReactJS SPA
on a Kubernetes cluster along with all other applications in an single domain.
The motivation was having it with strong Auth so that I could integrate with
APIs without stubbing out the Auth so that the application could run on my
desktop.

The approach I am trying is to run the server run on the cluster minikube in
this case and share my file system with minikube this way I can do local
development but the SPA is run from the cluster.

First I would get this to work with Docker and then get this to run on Kubernetes
using a helm chart.

```bash
docker pull node:15.5.0-alpine
docker run -it  -p 8080:3000 --entrypoint /bin/sh -v /Users/seizadi/project/reactjs-sample:/host -w /host node:15.5.0-alpine
```

From inital testing looks like everything we need yarn ... is already installed so we don't need
to create a new container.

```bash
docker run -it  -p 8080:3000 --entrypoint "yarn start" -v /Users/seizadi/project/reactjs-sample:/host -w /host node:15.5.0-alpine
```

This did not work as expected :(
```bash
docker: Error response from daemon: OCI runtime create failed: container_linux.go:349: starting 
container process caused "exec: \"yarn start\": executable file not found in $PATH": unknown
```

Tried a few things and did not work so I decided to get a Dockerfile setup to test it.

```bash
docker run -it  -p 8080:3000 -v /Users/seizadi/project/reactjs-sample:/host -w /host soheileizadi/reactjs-k8s:latest
yarn run v1.22.5

You can now view reactjs-sample in the browser.

```

Ok now time to package this for running it on kubernetes!
Now with helm chart done and we need to make sure that the
target for development is mounted on minkube:

```bash
‚ùØ minikube mount /Users/seizadi/projects/reactjs-sample:/host
üöÄ  Userspace file server: ufs starting
‚úÖ  Successfully mounted /Users/seizadi/projects/reactjs-sample to /host

üìå  NOTE: This process must stay alive for the mount to be accessible ...
```


```bash
k create namespace test
namespace/test created
 
kname test
Context "minikube" modified.

cd helm
helm install react-test .
```
When I look at logs I get this error...

```bash
‚ùØ k get pods

 To debug this I set it back nginx container to test the volume configuration, remember to
set the port back I had the health check failing...

```bash

The mount looks fine with mount:
```bash
‚ùØ k exec -it test-reactjs-k8s-56cc7669df-x7fv9 -- /bin/sh
# ls /host
README.md  node_modules  package.json  public  src  tsconfig.json  yarn.lock
# pwd
/host
```
Looks like it is an issue with the ReactJS project and yarn, so I go back to docker and reproduce this problem with
this project:
```bash
docker run -it  -p 8080:3000 -v  /Users/seizadi/projects/...ui:/host -w /host soheileizadi/reactjs-k8s:latest
yarn run v1.22.5
$ react-scripts start
‚Ñπ ÔΩ¢wdsÔΩ£: Project is running at http://172.17.0.3/

‚Ñπ ÔΩ¢wdsÔΩ£: Content not from webpack is served from /host/public
‚Ñπ ÔΩ¢wdsÔΩ£: 404s will fallback to /
Starting the development server...
Files successfully emitted, waiting for typecheck results...

```

That works on docker! :( WTF

I remembered I had turned on proxy on this:
```bash
  "proxy": "http://127.0.0.1:4433",
```
So I removed that from configuration to see if that makes a difference. Answer NO!

Then I put console.log in the first code that excutes and I see it in the docker run but not in the
minikube run, so it does not execute any of the script. At this point I try this on kind,
see this [kind guide on how to setup mounts](https://kind.sigs.k8s.io/docs/user/configuration/#extra-mounts)
```bash
kind: Cluster
apiVersion: kind.x-k8s.io/v1alpha4
nodes:
- role: control-plane
  # add a mount from /path/to/my/files on the host to /files on the node
  extraMounts:
  - hostPath: /Users/seizadi/project/reactjs-sample
    containerPath: /host
```

Create cluster...
```bash
‚ùØ kind create cluster --config config-with-mounts.yaml
....
‚ùØ k logs test-reactjs-k8s-84ff496648-wg7zn
yarn run v1.22.5
$ react-scripts start
‚Ñπ ÔΩ¢wdsÔΩ£: Project is running at http://10.244.0.5/
‚Ñπ ÔΩ¢wdsÔΩ£: webpack output is served from 
‚Ñπ ÔΩ¢wdsÔΩ£: Content not from webpack is served from /host/public
‚Ñπ ÔΩ¢wdsÔΩ£: 404s will fallback to /
Starting the development server...
```

So this works on kind cluster and the problem is with minikube running this workload!
I guess this means I will stop using minikube for now.

Disable Readiness and Liveness probes
```bash
  Warning  Unhealthy    4m3s                   kubelet            Readiness probe failed: Get "http://10.244.0.5:3000/": context deadline exceeded (Client.Timeout exceeded while awaiting headers)
  Warning  Unhealthy    4m3s                   kubelet            Liveness probe failed: Get "http://10.244.0.5:3000/": context deadline exceeded (Client.Timeout exceeded while awaiting headers)
  Norma
```

Now the whole system comes up...
```bash
‚ùØ k logs test-reactjs-k8s-5cb9c9b456-vxhvp
yarn run v1.22.5
$ react-scripts start
‚Ñπ ÔΩ¢wdsÔΩ£: Project is running at http://10.244.0.6/
